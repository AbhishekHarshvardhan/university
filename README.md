Please follow below steps to run the application

- Install all the node packages using "yarn install"
- Run "yarn start"
- Navigate to localhost:3000 to view the project in development mode
- Use "yarn build" to build the project for production.

* Please note that you must have node and yarn installed locally, I will add a docker config soon.
